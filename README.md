A simple game where a player will guess a number between a range of increasing values (i.e. 1-10, 15-20, etc).
The player guesses using an input field and a submit button. The player will have feedback after a guess, which
will confirm if the player's guess was correct or incorrect. The player has a maximum number of guesses, and once
the player runs out of guesses, the game will display that the player has lost, and a 'Play Again' button will be 
available for the player to play again. The 'Play Again' button also will display after the player wins, allowing
the to play again.
